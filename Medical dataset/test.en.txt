Surgical Treatment of Urethral Stricture After Hypospadias Repair: Experience on 49 Patients
In this study, the Folin-Ciocalteu method was applied to determine the total polyphenol contents (referred to milligrams gallic acid mass equivalence or GAE) in tea products (one oolong and three ancient teas, including red, green, and white) based on ISO 14502 - 1: 2005 with some modifications, typically ultrasonic-assisted single extraction using methanol: water (7: 3 v / v) as an extraction solvent at 70oC with the extraction ratio of 0.200: 10.00 (g: mL).
The analytical method was validated using Shimadzu 1800 UV-Vis instrument with favorable linearity of R2 > 0.995, linear range of 10 - 70 mg GAE L-1, acceptable repeatability, reproducibility (% RSDs were 0.79 and 1.2 for intra-day and inter-day, respectively), and high recoveries (higher than 98% for spiked samples).
The total polyphenol contents (mean values, mg GAE g-1 dried weight, in brackets) performed a descending order of white (206.62) ~ green (201.33) > red (167.42) > oolong (139.18) teas due to the variation in the oxidation levels during the fermentation, particularly for red and oolong teas.
Higher polyphenol contents released in tea infusions were observed regarding the increasing brewing temperature, except for oolong tea with its specific fluctuation, maybe due to its "wrap-curled" structure, leading to longer brewing durations for polyphenol to be extracted stably and completely.
This study contributes to enriching data for Vietnamese tea products in the context of high production and export.

Outcome of cementless total hip arthroplasty for osteonecrosis of the hip in Tam Anh hospital
Virus-caused Acute Respiratory Tract Infections (ARTIs) are among the most frequent diseases worldwide, with a high fatality rate.
The worldwide influenza and covid-19 pandemics have had a serious impact on humanity because the viral mutations develop at a rate quicker than human ability to discover, manufacture, and distribute vaccines, as well as immunisation.
Furthermore, the widespread use of antibiotics to treat respiratory co-infection bacteria without a doctor's prescription contributes to an increase in antibiotic resistance.
In view of this situation, many scientists around the world have researched and developed probiotics, also known as beneficial bacteria, to support the treatment and prevention ofARTIs because this is a safe and potentially effective approach.
Recently, LiveSpo® Pharma successfully created LiveSpo® Navax, a physiological saline suspension containing 5-billion beneficial Bacillus spores for ear, nose, and throat spraying administration.

Evaluation of the result of intracranial aneurysm microsurgical treatment by clipping
Three genes p53, rarα1, wnt and liver of Medaka fish tissue were selected to study the toxicity of DDT to fish embryo (8 days old) and adult Medaka fish (3 months old).
TEM and real-time PCR methods were used to examine changes in structure of liver tissue and genetic expression.
The TEM results recorded a clear difference between the control and the experimental sample.
Adult Medaka fish exposed to 1 μg / L DDT for 24 hours has a distorted liver cell nucleus with many hollow lipid particles, and the sinus-shaped meshes are clustered, interrupted; lysosome is not intact with many degenerative bubbles.
The results of real-time PCR analysis showed that DDT affects the development, different and proliferation of cells in the embryonic stage and gene expression in adult stage.
All three genes p53, rarα1 and wnt in fish embryos changed strongly and tended to be inhibited when exposuring with 1700 μg / L DDT, the values were recorded respectively 0.9; 4.9 and 5.4 times compared to the control sample (1 times).
For adult fish, gene expression was lower than fish embryos with real-time PCR analysis values for the three genes p53, rarα1 and wnt respectively 0.9 and 0.5; 0.36 and 0.09; 0.53 and 0.09 times after exposure to 1500 and 1700 μg / L DDT.
These results demonstrated that gene expression is dependent on the developmental stage of the cell as well as on the dose of the chemical exposed.

Assessment of the result of primary and microdissection thinning anterolateral thigh flap in plastic surgery
Pheochromocytoma (PCC) and Paraganglioma (PLG) are neuroendocrine tumors.
The patients were determined as having hypertension accompanied with abdominal mass.
Definitive diagnosis was Pheochromocytoma.
One in two patients was identified as carrying mutation of gene encoded succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur subunit B (SDHB).
Tumors derived from adrenal medulla secreting catecholamines, called Pheochromocytoma.
Tumors with extra adrenal origin, which either secrete cathecholamines or are nonfunctional termed Paraganglioma.
Because of similar clinical manifestations and treatment therapies of Phechromocytoma and catecholaminessecreting Paraganglioma, clinicians use the term "pheochromocytoma" to refer to both of tumors.
Pherochromocytomas is a rare disease in children with the estimated incidence is about 1 per 50.000 to 100.000 children.
This disorder could be sporadic or sometimes it could present as a part of inherit syndromes, such as von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1, heteditary Pheochromocytoma / Paraganglioma.

IgG4 RELATED SIALANDENITIS IN CHILDREN: A CASE REPORT
Ohtahara syndrome is one of the earliest and most severe forms of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.
Over the last decade, the rapid advances in molecular techniques, especially in high-throughput sequencing (HTS), have revealed that a majority of Ohtahara patients have genetic etiology.
About 20 genes have been found to be related to this syndrome so far, and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique is now an important genetic test for this syndrome.
This study was conducted on 4 patients with Ohtahara syndrome referred to Children's Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City.
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) following targeted analysis on 283 epileptic encephalopathy-related genes was performed to identify disease-causing variants of the patients.
Following multi-step bioinformatics analysis, trio-based Sanger sequencing confirmation, and variant classification according to standards of The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics - 2015, we have identified 2 pathogenic mutations in 2 patients: OH3 (KCNQ2, c.868G>A, p G290S) and OH4 (SCN2A, c.788C>T, p A263V).
This study also confirms that NGS in general and WES, in particular, are reliable and useful in detecting genetic causes of Ohtahara syndrome, thereby, assisting in diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome.

Epilepsy is a disease common in the nervous system.
The prevalence of epilepsy is estimated at 1% of the population.
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) provide good control of seizures, but some hypersensitivity reactions to AEDs have also been reported.
Side effects of AEDs include early manifestations (drowsiness, dizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms, even worsening of convulsions) and late manifestations (psychotic episodes, behavioral disturbances, depression, cognitive impairment, osteoporosis, leukopenia).
Cutaneous adverse reactions that fall under the category of early manifestations, ranging from mild reactions such as skin rashes (MPE), to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) include Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis). (TEN), symptomatic systemic drug reactions with eosinophilia (DRESS) and acute systemic pustular rash (AGEP).
The use of aromatic antiepileptic drugs such as Carbamazepine, Oxcarbazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Lamotrigine, Primidone and Zonisamide are often associated with skin rash and other symptomsand signs of drug hypersensitivity.
Patients with allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to AEDs have a higher incidence cross-sensitization is high (40 - 80%), which suggests that chemically structer similar antiepileptic drugs should be avoided in high-risk populations.

Salivary cortisol concentration, anxiety and pain in deviated lower third molar surgery
Background: In oral surgery, lower third molar surgery supposedly makes patient most anxious.
Result: Salivary cortisol concentration and anxiety levels of patients were correlated (p<0.05).
The correlation between these two variables was positive (Pearson +).
Patients with high dental anxiety had greater postoperative pain at 2 hours, 4 hours after the lip numb.
Salivary cortisol concentration and postoperative pain levels were not correlated.
Conclusion: Salivary cortisol concentration before deviated lower third molar surgery can suggest dental anxiety. However, it doesnt predict the level of postoperative pain.
Keywords: salivary cortisol, dental anxiety, pain after surgery, lower third molar surgery
To evaluate anxious level, using scale is subjective.
Finding an objective indicator to measure this problem is still controversial, in which salivary Cortisol is one of the suggested factors.
In addition, there was no consistency among studies on the relationship between anxiety measurement scales and the level of pain after deviated lower third molar surgery.
So, does there exist an objective predictive indicator that reflects the level of postoperative pain?
Does the change in salivary cortisol concentration affect the postoperative pain level?
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate salivary cortisol concentration before deviated lower third molar surgery whether is an objective factor to evaluate anxious level and postoperative pain.
Methods: A descriptive cross - sectional study was performed of 95 patients who underwent lower third molar extractions from June 2018 to May 2019 at Oral Surgery Unit, Faculty of Odonto - Stomatology, The University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh city.
Dental anxiety was evaluated using the DASS-21, postoperative pain was assessed on VAS scale and we determined salivary cortisol concentration before surgery by ELISA with Elecsys Cortisol II Cobas.
